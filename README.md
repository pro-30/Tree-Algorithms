# Tree-Algorithms
My solution to all the CSES Tree Algorithms Problems.

Problems available at : https://cses.fi/problemset/list/
 
1) Subordinates :      Dynamic Programming to calculate subtree size rooted at each node.

2) Tree Matching :      Dynamic Programming on Trees.

3) Tree Diameter :      1st solution based on Proof of Diamter. 2nd using Dynamic Programming on Trees where we try all possible paths.

4) Tree Distances I  :  Dynamic Programming on Trees + Rerooting Technique.

5) Tree Distances II :  Dynamic Programming on Trees + Rerooting Technique.

6) Company Queries I :  Binary Lifting(which in itself is a Dynamic Programing Approach).

7) Company Queries II : Answer LCA queries in O(logn) Time Using Binary Lifting . (Note: Binary Search + Binary Lifting Will give TLE because it will be  O(logÂ²n) per query ).

8) Distance Queries   : Binary Lifting.
